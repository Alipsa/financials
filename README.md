## Functions

### Payment
`pmt <- function(interestRate, nper, pv, fv = 0, type = 0)`

Equivalent to Excel/Calc's PMT(interest_rate, number_payments, PV, FV, Type)
function, which calculates the payments for a loan or the future value of an investment
#### Parameters
- _interestRate_ periodic interest rate represented as a decimal.
- _nper_ number of total payments / periods.
- _pv_   present value -- borrowed or invested principal.
- _fv_   future value of loan or annuity, default to 0 (which is what you want for loans)
- _type_ when payment is made: beginning of period is 1; end is 0. Default is 0

#### Value
_returns_ A double representing the periodic payment amount.

#### Example
__Calulate payment for a loan__

The following data:

| Item            | amount |
| -----           | -----  |
| Loan Amount	  |  50000 |
| Interest rate	  |  3.50% |
| Periods	      |     60 |
| Monthly payment |	909.59 |

Then the Monthly payment can be calculated as
`pmt(3.5/100/12, 60, -50000)`

### Monthly Annuity Amount
`monthlyAnnuityAmount <- function(loanAmount, interestRate, tenureMonths, amortizationFreemonths = 0, type = 0)`

Calculate the monthly annuity amount i.e. the amortization and interest amount each payment period (month)

#### Parameters
- _loanAmount_ the total loan amount including capitalized fees (e.g. startup fee)
- _interestRate_ the annual nominal interest
- _tenureMonths_ the tenure of the loan in number of months
- _amortizationFreeMonths_ the number of initial amortization free months, default to 0
- _type_ - when payment is made: beginning of period is 1; end is 0. Default is 0

#### Value
_returns_ the monthly annuity amount

#### Example
Assuming the following:

| Item            | amount |
| -----           | -----  |
| Loan Amount	  |  50000 |
| Interest rate	  |  3.50% |
| Tenure	      |     60 |
| Amortization Free months |	6 |

The monthly annuity amount would be
`monthlyAnnuityAmount(50000, 3.5/100, 60, 6)` = 1002.10

### Cash Flow
`cashFlow <- function(loanAmount, interestRate, tenureMonths, amortizationFreeMonths, invoiceFee)`

#### Parameters
- _loanAmount_ the total loan amount including capitalized fees (e.g. startup fee)
- _interestRate_ the annual nominal interest
- _tenureMonths_ the tenure of the loan in number of months
- _amortizationFreeMonths_ the number of initial amortization free months, default to 0
- _invoiceFee_ a fee for each statement invoiced, default to 0

#### Value
_returns_ a vector of cachFlow entries for each period

#### Example
```r
cf <- cashFlow(
  loanAmount=50000,
  interestRate=0.035,
  tenureMonths=60,
  amortizationFreeMonths=6,
  invoiceFee=30
)
```

### Payment Plan
`paymentPlan <- function(loanAmount, interestRate, tenureMonths, amortizationFreeMonths = 0, invoiceFee = 0)`

#### Parameters
- _loanAmount_ the total loan amount including capitalized fees (e.g. startup fee)
- _interestRate_ the annual nominal interest
- _tenureMonths_ the total tenure of the loan in number of months
- _amortizationFreeMonths_ the number of initial amortization free months, default to 0
- _invoiceFee_ a fee for each statement invoiced, default to 0

#### Value
_returns_ a dataframe with the initial payment plan based on the input, based on monthly payment periods

#### Example

```r
loanAmt <- 10000
tenureMonths <- 1.5 * 12
amortizationFreeMonths <- 6
interest <- 3.5 / 100
invoiceFee <- 30

ppdf <- paymentPlan(loanAmt, interest, tenureMonths, amortizationFreeMonths, invoiceFee)
```

which will yield a data.frame (ppdf) as follows:

| month	| costOfCredit | interestAmt | amortization | invoiceFee | outgoingBalance | cashFlow |
| ----  | --------     | ------      | ------       | ------     | ------          | ----     |

### Total Payment amount
`totalPaymentAmount <- function(loanAmount, interestRate, tenureMonths, amortizationFreeMonths = 0, invoiceFee = 0)`

Total Payment amount is the sum of all payments.
#### Parameters

- _interestRate_ the annual nominal interest
- _tenureMonths_ the total tenure of the loan in number of months
- _amortizationFreeMonths_ the number of initial amortization free months, default to 0
- _invoiceFee_ a fee for each statement invoiced, default to 0

#### Value
_returns_ a double containing the sum of all payments 

#### Example

```r
loanAmt <- 10000
tenureMonths <- 1.5 * 12
amortizationFreeMonths <- 6
interest <- 3.5 / 100
invoiceFee <- 30

totalAmt <- totalPaymentAmount(loanAmt, interest, tenureMonths, amortizationFreeMonths, invoiceFee)
print(totalAmt)
```
```

```

### Internal Rate of Return
`irr <- function(cf, precision = 1e-6)`

#### Parameters
- _cf_ a vector of the cash flow (see cashflow function)
- 
#### Value
_returns_ a double containing the internal return rate

#### Example
Given the cache flow above

```r
internalReturn <- irr(ppdf$cashFlow)
print(internalReturn)

#### Value
_Returns_ a double with the annual percentage rate

#### Example
```r
annualPercentage <- apr(internalReturn)

```

### Net present value

`npv <- function(i, cf, t=seq(along=cf))`

Net present value (NPV) is the difference between the present value
of cash inflows and the present value of cash outflows over a period of time.
This function produces the same results as Excel does which differs from packages such as FinCal.

#### Parameters
- _i_ interest rate
- _cf_ cache flow e.g. the cashFlow vector of the payment plan
- _t_ time series (optional)

#### Value
_Returns_ a double with the net present value

#### Examples
```r
print(npv(cf = c(-123400, 36200, 54800, 48100), i = 0.035))
```
